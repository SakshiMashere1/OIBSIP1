    <h2>Game Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Computer generates a random number between 1 and 100</li>
        <li>Player has 10 attempts per round to guess the number</li>
        <li>Game consists of 3 rounds</li>
        <li>Computer provides feedback (too high/too low) after each guess</li>
        <li>Score is calculated based on remaining attempts</li>
        <li>Input validation to ensure proper number entry</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How to Run:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Copy the code into a file named <code>NumberGuessingGame.java</code></li>
        <li>Compile with <code>javac NumberGuessingGame.java</code></li>
        <li>Run with <code>java NumberGuessingGame</code></li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Customization Options:</h2>
    <p>You can easily modify these constants at the top of the code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>MAX_ATTEMPTS</code> - Change the number of guesses allowed per round</li>
        <li><code>MAX_ROUNDS</code> - Change how many rounds to play</li>
        <li><code>POINTS_PER_ROUND</code> - Adjust the scoring system</li>
        <li>Change the range by modifying the <code>random.nextInt(100) + 1</code> line</li>
    </ul>
